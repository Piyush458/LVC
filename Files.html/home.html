    <H1><u>LVC</u></H1>
    <p>A Live Virtual Classroom is a platform for delivering a trainer-led, interactive course in an online environment. 
        They are designed to replicate the experience and benefit of attending a face-to-face training course, with the same discussion, 
        group breakout work, questions and answers, and access to a responsive, knowledgeable expert.<br>

Advantages of LVC training over traditional class-based training include:<br>

Flexibility of allowing globally distributed teams to access training<br>
Reduced costs and time lost due to travel<br>
Supports corporate social responsibility initiatives by reducing carbon emissions<br></p>
